            The \`tonejs-json-sequencer\` dependency appears to be outdated.
            
            **Action Required:**
            \`\`\`bash
            npm update tonejs-json-sequencer
            npm run build:libs
            \`\`\`
            
            **Why this matters:** GitHub dependencies are pinned to specific commit SHAs in \`package-lock.json\`. Running \`npm install\` does NOT update them - you must use \`npm update\`.
            
            Please update the dependency before investigating library behavior to avoid working with outdated code.`;
