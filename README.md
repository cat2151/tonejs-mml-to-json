# Explanation in 3 Lines
- Converts music written in MML (Music Macro Language) into a JSON format playable in a browser.
- You can compose music with simple text and play it on a website.
- This tool specializes in the music conversion part; actual playback is handled by a separate project (`tonejs-json-sequencer`).

# Notes
- What are the advantages of writing music in MML (Music Macro Language)?
  - **Conciseness and Portability**: Text-based and lightweight; platform-independent for the web.
  - **Developer Friendliness**: Code-like notation, easy Git management, and generation.
  - **Web Development Affinity**: Direct playback in browsers, real-time editing, lightweight delivery.
  - **Low Learning Curve**: Simple grammar, enabling gradual learning.
  - **Modular Design**: Conversion and playback are separated, allowing independent evolution of each.
  - **Adaptability to Dialects**: Even system-specific MML dialects are expected to be easy to handle with simple conversions, as users can readily create them using PEG.

- Why are `tonejs-json-sequencer` and `tonejs-mml-to-json` separate projects?
  - **To emphasize development independence and speed.**
    - Allows focusing on MML parser development.
    - Enables rapid evolution without being tied to dependencies between parser and playback functionalities.

# Notes on Consideration
## Input/Output Definition
- *Illustrate with examples to visualize the concept.*
- Input Example
  - `o4 l16 e`
- Intermediate Format Example
  - *Designed as loosely coupled layers to facilitate individual modifications.*
  - JSON (AST)
  - JSON (Pre-processed)
    - What is "processing"?
      - e.g., Node ID numbering
- Output Example
  - JSON (Post-processed)
    - Format recognized by tonejs-json-sequencer
    - Details omitted for brevity; refer to TDD test cases for specifics.
## TDD Approach
- The test targets are mml2ast, ast2ast, and ast2json, individually.
  - Refer to the TDD for mml2abc / chord2mml.
