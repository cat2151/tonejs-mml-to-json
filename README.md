# Summary
- Converts music written in MML (Music Macro Language) into a JSON format playable in browsers.
- Allows you to create music with simple text and play it on a website.
- This tool specializes in music conversion; the actual playback is handled by a separate project (`tonejs-json-sequencer`).

# Notes
- What are the advantages of writing music in MML (Music Macro Language)?
  - **Conciseness and Portability**: Text-based and lightweight, platform-independent for web use.
  - **Developer-Friendly**: Code-like notation, easy Git management, and generation.
  - **Web Development Affinity**: Direct playback in browsers, real-time editing, lightweight delivery.
  - **Low Learning Curve**: Simple syntax, allowing for gradual learning.
  - **Modular Design**: Conversion and playback are separated, allowing independent evolution.
  - **Foundation for Ecosystem**: Highly reusable, facilitating knowledge sharing and accumulation.
  - **Adaptability to Dialects**: Even system-specific MML dialects are expected to be easily supported by creating simple converters with PEG.

- Why are `tonejs-json-sequencer` and `tonejs-mml-to-json` separate projects?
  - **Prioritizing development independence and speed.**
    - Allows focusing solely on MML parser development.
    - Enables rapid evolution without being constrained by dependencies between parser and playback functionalities.

# Notes on Consideration
## Input/Output Definitions
- *Illustrate with examples to visualize the concept.*
- Input Example
  - `o4 l16 e`
- Intermediate Format Example
  - *Aiming for loosely coupled, thin layers to facilitate changes in each.*
  - JSON (AST)
  - JSON (Pre-processed)
    - What is "processing"?
      - Node ID assignment, etc.
- Output Example
  - JSON (Post-processed)
    - Format recognized by tonejs-json-sequencer.
    - Details omitted for brevity; the TDD test cases will serve as the detailed specification.
## TDD Approach
- The test targets are mml2ast, ast2ast, and ast2json, individually.
  - Refer to the TDD for mml2abc / chord2mml.
