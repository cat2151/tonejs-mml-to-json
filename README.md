# Explanation in 3 Lines
- Converts music written in MML (Music Macro Language) into a JSON format playable in a browser.
- Allows you to create music using simple text and play it on a website.
- This tool specializes in music conversion; actual playback is handled by a separate project (`tonejs-json-sequencer`).

# Notes
- What are the benefits of writing music in MML (Music Macro Language)?
  - **Conciseness and Portability**: Text-based, lightweight, and platform-independent for the web.
  - **Developer-Friendly**: Code-like notation, easy Git management and generation.
  - **Web Development Affinity**: Direct playback in browsers, real-time editing, lightweight delivery.
  - **Low Learning Curve**: Simple syntax, allows for gradual learning.
  - **Modular Design**: Conversion and playback are separated, allowing independent evolution of each.
  - **Foundation for an Ecosystem**: Highly reusable, easy to share and accumulate knowledge.
  - **Adaptability to Dialects**: Even system-specific MML dialects can be easily supported by creating individual PEG parsers for simple conversions.

- Why are `tonejs-json-sequencer` and `tonejs-mml-to-json` separate projects?
  - **To prioritize development independence and speed.**
    - Allows focusing solely on MML parser development.
    - Enables rapid evolution without being constrained by dependencies between parser and playback functionalities.

# Notes Under Consideration
## Input/Output Definition
- *Visualize with examples to clarify the concept.*
- Input Example
  - `o4 l16 e`
- Intermediate Format Example
  - *Aim for loosely coupled, thin layers to facilitate changes to each.*
  - json (AST)
  - json (pre-processed)
    - What is processing?
      - nodeId numbering, etc.
- Output Example
  - json (post-processed)
    - Format recognized by tonejs-json-sequencer
    - Details omitted for brevity; the TDD test cases serve as the detailed specification.
## TDD Approach
- The test targets are mml2ast, ast2ast, and ast2json, individually.
  - Refer to the TDD of mml2abc / chord2mml.
- I believe this project used Vitest for TDD.
  - I plan to organize the testing procedures later.
